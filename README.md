# Blog source
I prefer writing blog in markdown with Typora. It has a feature that can convert a *.md file into *.html

I've learned that `git push` is necessary when setting a blog via Github pages, I don't want to learn how other framework works, so I build a blog tool for myself.

if you like this, you can use my way.

# How this works?

1.I build a blog site with theme.

2.write a one-key cmd file for generate html and git push.

3.updated.
