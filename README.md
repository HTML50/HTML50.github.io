# Blog source
I prefer writing blog in markdown with Typora. It has a feature that can convert a *.md file into *.html

I've learned that `git push` is necessary when setting a blog via Github pages, I don't want to learn how other framework works, so I build a blog tool for myself.

if you like this, you can use my way.

# How this works?

1.I build a blog site with theme.

2.Wrte a new blog and export  it into html file to blog folder.

3.write a  batch file for update stie and git push. (the batch is mainly find the newest html file and put it into the blog list)

4.updated.

## PS

this tool is for my personal usage, only work in Windows. If you want to build a site without any frameworks and publish on Github, you can try. I feel good about this way.
