# What is this

It is my blog. And I build this with Javascript and CSS, no framework at all.

have a glimpse of my blog (CHINESE character)

http://es5.site



# Why 

I prefer writing blog in markdown with Typora, which has a feature that can convert a *.md file into *.html

I've learned that `git push` is necessary when setting a blog via Github pages, I don't want to learn how other framework works, so I build a blog tool for myself.

if you like, you can clone this repo and have a try.



# How to use

1. download the zip
2. wrte a new blog in Typora, and export it into `html` file
3. put the *.html into this folder `./blog`, and *.png into `./list-img`
4. execute update.bat (update.bat mainly finds the newest html file and write it into the blog list page) and done!



## PS

this tool is only work in Windows ( because of I used *.bat for auto update ).

If you want to build a site without any frameworks and publish on Github, you can give a try. I feel good about this.
